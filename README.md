</h1>
I am a junior *high-perfomance computing* systems engineer/administrator. I just like to build, break, and secure systems.

## As a HPC system engineer
As a hpc system engineer I design, build, and maintain clusters. Some of the tasks I do:
- building virutal clusters using virutal machines and provisioning them
- creating users on the cluster we have and maintaining their accounts and data
- installing applications on the cluster for end users
- regularly testing clusters functionality and performance
- handling users problems and tickets
- automating processes *(e.g. the user creation steps)*
- documenting everything;
  - clusters usage
  - applications installations
  - systems tests
  - etc..

## As a hacker
As a hacker I like to break web applications. Some of the tasks I do:
- doing reconnaissance to explore search space
- searching for vulnerabilities existing in found endpoints
- searching for available exploits
- documenting my thought process

## CTFs
I like solving some capture the flag challenges.
